<h2>How To Make Crème Brûlée</h2>
<p> 
    <strong>Crème brûlée</strong> or crème brulée (/ˌkrɛm bruːˈleɪ/; French pronunciation: [kʁɛm bʁy.le]), also known as burnt cream or Trinity cream,and virtually identical to the original crema catalana, is a dessert consisting of a rich custard base topped with a layer of hardened caramelized sugar. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It is normally served slightly chilled; the heat from the caramelizing process tends to warm the top of the custard, while leaving the center cool. The custard base is traditionally flavored with vanilla in French cuisine, but can have other flavorings. It is sometimes garnished with fruit.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of heavy or light cream</li>
        <li>1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>5 egg yolks</li>
        <li>half cup granulated sugar, keep more aside for topping</li>
    </ul>

<ol>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <li>Heat oven to 325 degrees. In a saucepan, combine cream, vanilla bean and salt; cook over low heat just until hot. Let sit for a few minutes, then discard vanilla bean. (If using vanilla extract, add it now.)</li>
    <li>In a bowl, beat yolks and sugar together until light. Stir about a quarter of the vanilla cream into this mixture, then pour sugar-egg mixture into cream and stir. Pour into four 6-ounce ramekins and place ramekins in a baking dish; fill dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the ramekins.</li>
    <li>Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until centers are barely set. Cool completely. Refrigerate for several hours and up to a couple of days.</li>
    <li>When ready to serve, top each custard with about a teaspoon of sugar in a thin layer.</li>
    <li>Place ramekins in a broiler 2 to 3 inches from heat source. Turn on broiler. Cook until sugar melts and browns or even blackens a bit, about 5 minutes. Serve within 2 hours.</li>
