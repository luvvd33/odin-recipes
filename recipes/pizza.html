<h2>How To Make a Pizza</h2>

    Everybody loves pizza. Well, most. If you're here looking for a pizza recipe, i'm assuming you're one of them. Pizzas can be customised
    to your own preference and that's what's so special about pizzas.

        Here's the recipe to a pizza I have made. You can of course customize it to your own 
        preference. This is just a basic guideline. If you're vegan/vegetarian, feel free to use alternatives to the meat, etc.

    <p>
        Preheat the oven at 180 degree Celsius. Now, is the time to make the pizza base when the dough is ready. Dust the space a little using dry flour and take a large amount of the pizza dough. Using a rolling pin, roll this dough into a nice circular base. (Note: Make sure that the circular base is even at all ends.) Once you have made the base, use a fork and prick the base with it so that the base doesn't rise and gets baked nicely. Put it into the preheated oven and bake it 10 minutes. Now, your pizza base is ready.

    Now, wash the capsicum and slice it thinly in a bowl. Then, peel the onions and cut thin slices of it as well in another bowl. And finally, cut tomatoes and mushrooms in the same manner. However, make sure that those tomatoes have less juice in them. Once all the veggies are done, Now, grate the processed and mozzarella cheese in separate bowls.

<li><h3>Spread the sauce and veggies on the base</h3></li>
<p>
    Then, take the fresh pizza base and apply tomato ketchup all over. Spread half the processed cheese all over the base and evenly put the veggies all across the base. Once you have put all the veggies, put a thick layer of mozzarella cheese.
</p>

<li><h3>Bake the pizza at 250 degree Celcius for 10 minutes</h3></li>
